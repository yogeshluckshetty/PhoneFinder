<h1 class="mainhead">About Us</h1>
<p>Phones have become a huge part of our lives. Now a days almost everybody owns a phone. But everybody is in a dilemma before buying a phone. They know how much they are willing to spend on their new phone, they know which size phone they want, etc basically they know what all they want in their phone but they dont know which phone to buy.

Our website will help people decide on to which phone they want to buy by asking the user what they want in their phone. We have used the following languages 
1)HTML
2)CSS
3)MySQL
4)PHP
Using HTML we made the layout of the page,using CSS we styled our page and using MySQL we made a database for the phones and their features.PHP connects the HTML file to the database. HTML and CSS are used for front end programming. MySQL and PHP are used for back end programming.
